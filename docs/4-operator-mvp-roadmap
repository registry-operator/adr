## Context and Problem Statement

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) refers to the initial version of a product that includes only the essential features needed to meet the needs of early adopters and gather feedback for future development. MVP for release 0.1.0 should be defined at the beginning of our project together with roadmap, which provides a visual and strategic overview of a project's goals, key milestones and timelines.

## Considered Options

* **Small MVP**:
    - empty operator scaffolding;
* **Medium MVP**:
    - configuring `Registry` with default configuration;
* **Large MVP**:
    - configuring `Registry` using protocols `s3` and `filesystem`.

## Decision Outcome

Selected option: "Medium MVP" with default configuration, because empty operator scaffolding doesn't provide any project value from `Registry` perspective, but integration with protocols like `s3` and `filesystem` will be demanding and need a stable working fundations. 

As a descussion result the detailed `ROADMAP.md` is created in `registry-operator` repo.
